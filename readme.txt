Adds simple counters badge (Facebook friends or fans and Twitter followers) to your blog.

== Description ==

This plugin adds simple counters badge (Facebook and Twitter) to your blog. This badge shows for blog readers a counter of your Facebook friends or site page fans and Twitter followers. It also provides "Be my friend" and "Follow me" links for your users.

This is full customisable plugin. You can customise font and background (gradient) colors, background gradient vector direction, images, hint colors and themes, badge position on browser screen, etc.

Available languages:

  * English
  * Russian
  * Serbo-Croatian by [Anja Skrba](http://webhostinggeeks.com/wordpresshosting.php)  

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, you can send __.po__ and __.mo files__ to me so that I can bundle it into __Simple Counters__.
  
Real example of badge you can see on my [blog](http://www.simplelib.com/)

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin dir to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set your FeedBurner and Twitter IDs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have just installed this plug-in. The quantity of subscribers is displayed, and data Twitter does not show. Shows a null string. In what a problem? =

Some hosting-providers, especially providers rendering services of a free hosting, lock requests to popular services. In this case it is necessary for you to redirect data request to client side. Include an option "Redirect data request to client side".
In other case if the error arises because of hard traffic to service, increase value of "request timeout".

In any case, for upgrade of value of counters, simply save parametres of a plug-in. Values of counters will be refreshed immediately.
